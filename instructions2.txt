üåê How to Temporarily Host QuantumShare with Ngrok (Until Public Hosting)
If you'd like to use QuantumShare with your friends before it‚Äôs officially hosted online, you can run it on your machine and share it using Ngrok. Here's how.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Local Hosting with Ngrok
1. Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed:
https://nodejs.org/

2. Install Ngrok
Download Ngrok from:
https://ngrok.com/download

Unzip and place it somewhere in your system PATH.

3. Install dependencies
In your terminal, inside the project folder:

npm install
4. Start the server
npm start
The app will run at:
http://localhost:3000

5. Start an Ngrok tunnel
In a separate terminal:


ngrok http 3000
Ngrok will provide you with a public URL, like:


https://abc12345.ngrok.io
6. Share that link
Send that link to your friends ‚Äî they can open the app in their browser and use it with you in real time.

‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Note
Ngrok free plan allows sessions of ~2 hours and rotates the public URL each time.

If you'd like a custom subdomain or longer sessions, consider a paid Ngrok plan.

You must keep the terminal open with the Ngrok session running while using the app.

üì¶ Future: Public Hosting
At some point, QuantumShare may be deployed to a public web server (e.g. Vercel, Railway, or a VPS). When that happens, no Ngrok will be needed ‚Äî users will simply visit a URL like:

arduino
Kopiuj
Edytuj
https://quantumshare.example.com
Until then, this Ngrok setup is a simple and secure way to use the app across different devices and locations.
